      In specific case-related categories, your subjective assessments
      are made according to the expected performance of the of the
      person being assessed. The following ratings apply:
    </p>

    <p>
      <table cellspacing="10">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="example">P</span></td>
            <td>"Poor"</td>
            <td>a serious problem exists</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="example">A</span>
            <td>"Awkward"</td>
            <td>worthy of concentrated efforts to improve</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="example">C</span></td>
            <td>"Competent"</td>
            <td>precisely acceptable</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="example">E</span>
              <td>"Expert"</td>
              <td>finely done or expressed</td>

% }
% else {

    <p>
      As a trainee, you will judge your performance in terms of the
      "phases of technical skills acquisition."
    </p>

    <p>
      These categories are most appropriate for initial phases of
      learning a given task, and they are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cognitive &mdash; task performance almost totally under
          conscious control.  The learner is so absorbed in details
          he/she may be unaware of surrounding events. "Frontal Lobe
          execution".
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Integrative &mdash; learner is in the process of integrating
          the task completely. Acquiring the ability to recognize and
          learn the importance of situations and performance is under
          shared control: some activity requires conscious
          deliberation and others are automatic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Autonomous &mdash; task performance is "locked-in". With a
          repertoire of experience, the whole situation is recognized
          as similar to other situations and performance is under
          total or near total automatic control, leaving the person
          free to engage in other activities or to monitor and improve
          the performance presently taking place under automatic
          control.  "Cerebellar Lobe execution".
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These ratings are used to assess performance of specific
      procedures:
    </p>

    <table cellspacing="10">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">C</span></td>
          <td>"Cognitive"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">I</span>
          <td>"Integrative"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">A</span></td>
          <td>"Autonomous"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">P</span></td>
          <td>"Proficient"</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
% }
    <p>
      You will need a completely different system of ratings to assess
      <% $role eq 'trainee' ? 'your' : "your trainee's" %> general
      capabilities pertaining to the case. We suggest that you think
      of the general qualities, such as <em>Knowledge</em>, as being
      "sufficient" or "insufficient", and rate them on the following
      scale:
    </p>

    <table cellspacing="10">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">P</span>
          <td>"Poor"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">F</span></td>
          <td>"Fair"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">G</span></td>
          <td>"Good"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">VG</span></td>

        <tr>
          <td><span class="example">E</span></td>
          <td>"Excellent"</td>

    <h4>Navigating the tree menu</h4>

    <p>
      The hierarchy of procedures and elementary steps of an operation
      is approximately arranged in the order of the actual
      events. Some specific activities, such as <em>Patient
      preparation</em>, are grouped in modules representing the more
      general types of activities, such as <em>Procedure
      Initiation</em>, <em>Exploration</em>, <em>etc.</em> Such
      grouping allows your assessments to be as specific or as general
      as you may find appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you wish to simply state that

% if ( $role eq 'trainee' ) {
      you have done well
% } else {
      the trainee has done well
% }

      during the exploration phase, without focusing on specific
      details, find <em>Exploration Phase</em> in the tree
      corresponding to the specific case you are assessing (assuming
      this category is defined for that case), and push the button
      that best reflects your assessment, such as

% if ( $role eq 'trainee' ) {
      <span class="example">A</span> for "Autonomous".
% } else {
      <span class="example">AA</span> for "Above Average".
% }
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, you will assess <% $role eq 'trainee' ? 'your' :
      "your trainee's" %> general capabilities which are also arranged
      in a tree-like hierarchy.
    </p>

    <p>
      To fine-tune your assessments, expand the categories by clicking
      on the (+) icons until you reach the desired level of
      precision. A click on the (-) icon will completely collapse the
      view of the category. Clicking on the name of the category will
      toggle between the collapsed and the fully expanded view.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h4>Required Assessments</h4>

    <p>
      The categories shown on the assessment page when it first opens
      represent the level of generality at which all assessments are
      mandatory. You can expand these categories to give a more
      detailed assessment if you wish, but you cannot skip them, and
      you cannot rate the entire case without clicking on each of the
      top-level categories within.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h4>Non-participatory Activities</h4>

    <p>
      If, for any reason, <% $role eq 'trainee' ? 'you' : 'the
      trainee' %> did not participate in a certain activity and,
      therefore, that activity cannot be assessed, please specify what
      the reason was by selecting <span class="example l2">NP</span>
      and choosing one of the reasons from a drop-down menu.
