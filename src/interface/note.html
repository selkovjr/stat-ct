    <h3>Recording notes and sending feedback</h3>

    <h4>What are pearls?</h4>

    <p>
      One important activity this tool supports is recording
      case-related notes (the authors like to call them
      <em>pearls</em>) in a structured manner. If taxonomy of surgical
      cases is similar to a tree, your notes can be thought of as
      leaves on that tree. They can be attached anywhere &mdash; to
      the entire case, or to any of its components, large or
      small. The pearl entry form shows the full path from the root
      node of the case to the current node, to give you a reference
      for where it will be attached.
    </p>

    <h4>Entering pearls</h4>
    <p>
      Clicking on a pearl icon (<span
      class="pearl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</span>) next to an item on the <%
      $assessment_page %> will open a form, which you can use to write
      down any wisdom you learned during the case, or anything
      noteworthy related to this item. If you have already entered
      notes for this item in the past, it will be marked with a black
      pearl (<span class="blackpearl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</span>). There is no
      limit on how many notes you can enter for any given item.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe the best time to enter pearls is while you are
      assessing the case and while your memory is fresh. For this
      reason, we have linked the pearl entry form to the assessment
      form. But you do not have to be assessing the case in order to
      enter a random pearl any time you want. Just follow the steps
      you would normally take to assess a case, and click on a pearl
      in the assessment form. When done, simply navigate away from the
      page without submitting the assessment. Pearls and assessments
      are entered independently, but we have combined them on the same
      page for expediency.
    </p>

    <h4>The distinction between pearls and remarks</h4>
    <p>
      If the note you would like to enter is of general nature
      &mdash; something that applies to all cases of the same type, we
      refer to it as a pearl and recommend that you enter it as
      such. If it applies to the case as a whole, click on the pearl
      next to the case heading set in bold on the <% $assessment_page
      %>. However, if you want to add a note pertaining to a
      particular instance of the case &mdash; the instance you are
      assessing &mdash; then enter it using the <code>Remark</code>
      box on the same page.
    </p>

    <h4>Viewing pearls</h4>
    <p>
      When entered into the database, the pearls are timestamped, so
      they can be organized  in time, or grouped by the
      case type, or by individual phases of the case, or by any
      combination of these criteria.
    </p>

% if ( $mode eq 'display' ) {
    <p>
      If you have entered any pearls, you will see a black pearl icon
      (<span class="blackpearl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</span>) next
      to each category on the <a href=<% "/$STAT::application" %>>front page
      of STAT</a> that has cases with pearls attached to them. When
      you expand a category, you will see which case types in that
      category have received a pearl. Click on the pearl icon, and you
      will see all your pearls organized according to the structure of
      the case. If you click on a pearl in a top-level category, you
      will see all pearls entered for the cases in that category
      listed on the same page.
    </p>
% } else {
    <p>
      All earlier pearls you may have entered for the current
      node and all its subordinate nodes will be listed on this page
      under <b>Prior pearls</b>, with node labels set in faint color
      to provide context.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page will only list the pearls for the current node and its
      descendants. To see more pearls linked to the case you are
      assessing, <a href="javascript:history.go(-2)">step back</a> and
      and click on another pearl icon. To access all of your
      pearls, use the <% $index_page %>.
    </p>
%}

    <h4>Reporting Problems</h4>
    <p>
      The problem-reporting facility comes piggyback on the pearl
      mechanism. Please use it when you want to report any problems or
      have questions <em>regarding particular elements of the case
      you're assessing</em>. Instead of sending us email with a
      description of where you've found a problem, you can simply
      leave your report attached to the tree branch in question, and
      we will find it there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please press <code>Add a pearl</code> to leave a note for
      yourself, and press <code>Report a problem</code> to let us know
      of anything misplaced, misnamed, or in any way inaccurate. If
      you think that a necessary item is missing, attach your report
      to an existing item next to where you think the missing item
      should be.
    </p>

    <p>
      To report a more general problem, or any problem not related to
      the case taxonomy, please write to the email address at the
      bottom of this page.
    </p>
