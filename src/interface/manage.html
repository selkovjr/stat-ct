  <h3>Activity Tree Management</h3>

  <p>
    All assessments done in STAT are structured in the form of a tree
    representing procedures, activities, or general competencies,
    grouped according to their level of generality. The tree serves as
    a structured container for assessments and notes made by the users.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of this management tool is to allow the curator of the
    site to modify the structure of the tree and to set some node
    attributes. The semantics of different branches are interpreted by
    the assessment tools, which implement different behaviors and
    appearance based on the names of the top-level nodes. Therefore,
    operations that can be accomplished with this tool are limited to
    modifications of the structure; the semantic values, such as
    classes of ratings or grades that apply to a set of nodes are
    configured elsewhere (in the database schema or in the code).
  </p>

  <& lib/caution.mason, message => qq(Because the behavior of
  assessment tools is linked to the names of the top-level nodes, such
  as "General Capabilities" used in the assessment of persons, these
  nodes should not be edited by the user) &>

  <h4>Massive changes and the problem of data integrity</h4>

  <p>
    Although this tool provides a complete set of operations to
    accomplish arbitrary transformations of the tree, it can be
    inefficient if used to perform massive and complicated edits. In
    such cases, <a href="download.html">downloading</a> and editing
    the text form of the tree in a text editor may be easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Externally edited trees can be imported into the database using a
    command-line tool, <code>import_tree</code>.
  </p>
 
  <& lib/caution.mason, message => qq(Regardless of the method of
  editing, committing changes to the live production database will
  typically result in corruption of prior assessments linked with the
  earlier version of the tree. Because additions, deletions or
  transpositions result in a change of internal node IDs, merging of
  the updated tree into the live database requires a series of tedious
  manipulations of data tables, which cannot be done automatically.) &>

  <p>
    Due to the complexity of tree updates, it is best to work out the
    final shape of the tree before the system goes to production. As a
    rule, the more data is in the system, the more difficult it will
    be to reconcile the changes. In any such operation, the prior
    assessments corresponding to deleted elements of the tree must be
    discarded; assessments linked to tree nodes with the same meaning
    but different ids must be remapped. Renaming of nodes or
    substantial change in their meaning or usage may render the old
    data meaningless.
  </p>

  <h3>Operations</h3>

  <p>
    All operations are performed by clicking on the buttons near the
    top of the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two kinds of operations. Node operations apply to the
    currently selected node. To select a node, click in its name. The
    operations <code>Compare</code>, <code>Submit</code>, and
    <code>Cancel</code> apply to the entire tree.
  </p>

  <h4>Node operations</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Expand</b>
      <p>
        The initial view of the tree shows only its top-level
        nodes. Any node containing other nodes can be expanded to show
        its immediate children by clicking on the (+)-icon next to its
        name. The <input type="button" value="Expand"> button works
        differently: it serves expand the entire subtree under the
        currently selected node.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Add</b>
      <p>
        A click on the <input type="button" value="Add"> button
        creates a new child. The currently selected node becomes this
        new node's parent. The new node is defined by its name
        (label); additionally, one of the two attributes can be
        specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the hierarchies describing procedure steps, the
        <code>Procedure Performed</code> attribute specifies whether
        this node is optional or not (always/not always
        performed). This attribute does not change the behavior of the
        node in the assessment tool, but if the node is marked as
        optional, its rendering will be different, and in the training
        applications, it will not be flagged as non-particapatory
        (because such items are non-participatory by default).
      </p>
      <p>
	The second attribute, <code>Assessment Required</code>, is
	used by the validation logic in the assessment tool to tell
	the user that the assessment of the associated item is
	mandatory. Some items, such as the top-level nodes, are
	mandatory by default. The purpose of this attribute is to flag
	mandatory items deeper in the hierarchy, where the
	programmatic defaults do not apply.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Edit</b>
      <p>
	The <input type="button" value="Edit"> button permits changes
	in the name and attributes of the selected node (see the
	explanation of attributes for the <b>Add</b> opeartion above.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Copy</b>
      <p>
        This operation duplicates the content of the selected node,
        including all its descendants, in a hidden buffer. Copying a node
        (effectively, a subtree) does not result in a visible change
        in the tree. But the page reloads, reflecting a change in the
        status of the <input type="button" value="Paste"> button,
        which becomes enabled.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Cut</b>
      <p>
        This operation, like <b>Copy</b>, puts the content of the
        currently selected node in the paste buffer. But it also
        removes the selected node from the tree.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Reparent</b>
      <p>
        This one is a little tricky. It does two things. First, it
        takes all descendants of the current node and turns them into
        descendants of this node's parent. After that, their former
        parent (the currently selected node) gets killed. This
        operation is useful when a certain subtree is mistakenly
        placed at the wrong level of hierarchy.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Paste</b>
      <p>
        This operation places the content of the paste buffer (where it
        gets through either <b>Copy</b> or <b>Cut</b> operation)
        <em>inside</em> the selected node.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b>
      <p>
        These operations change the order of siblings.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Whole tree operations</h4>

  <p>
    All transformations of the tree occur in a temporary space. To
    make it permanent, press the <input type="button" value="Submit">
    button. The temporary tree will be copied in place of the
    permanent one and will become visible to STAT tools (also, that is
    how it can destroy the existing data &mdash; see the second
    warning near the top of this page).
  </p>

  <p>
    The active (permanent) version of the tree and the tree being
    edited in the temporary buffer can be compared by pressing the
    <input type="button" value="Compare"> button. The resulting page
    will present a line-by-line diff between the text versions of the
    two trees, in which lines marked with a (-) reperesent the areas
    of the original tree deleted to make room for the changes, whith
    additions in the new (temporary) tree makred with a (+). The
    meaning of (-) and (+) should be interpreted as "before and after
    the change".  The lines not marked with either (-) or (+) contain
    the text surrounding the changed region. For example, a change in
    just one character in the label of one of the nodes will be seen
    in the diff output as three lines of leading context, followed by
    a single (-)-line, followed by a single (+)-line, followed by
    three lines of trailing context.
  </p>

  <p>
    All changes to the temporary version of the tree can be rolled
    back by pushing the <input type="button" value="Cancel"> button.
  </p>
